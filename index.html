        <h2>Why is Christmas celebrated?</h2>
        <h4>Christmas is celebrated to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God.<br>
        <br>
        The name 'Christmas' comes from the Mass of Christ (or Jesus). A Mass service (which is sometimes called<br>
        Communion or Eucharist) is where Christians remember that Jesus died for us and then came back to life. The<br>
        'Christ-Mass' service was the only one that was allowed to take place after sunset (and before sunrise the next<br>
        day), so people had it at Midnight! So we get the name Christ-Mass, shortened to Christmas.<br>
        <br>
        Christmas is now celebrated by people around the world, whether they are Christians or not. It's a time when<br>
        family and friends come together and remember the good things they have. People, and especially children, also<br>
        like Christmas as it's a time when you give and receive presents!</h4></div>

        <h2>Why is New Year celebrated?</h2>
        <h4>New Year’s is one of the oldest holidays still celebrated, but the exact date and nature of the festivities<br>
         has changed over time. It originated thousands of years ago in ancient Babylon, celebrated as an<br>
         eleven day festival on the first day of spring. During this time, many cultures used the sun and moon<br>
         cycle to decide the “first” day of the year. It wasn’t until Julius Caesar implemented the Julian<br>
         calendar that January 1st became the common day for the celebration. The content of the festivities<br>
         has varied as well. While early celebrations were more paganistic in nature, celebrating Earth’s cycles,<br>
         Christian tradition celebrates the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on New Year’s Day. Roman<br>
         Catholics also often celebrate Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, a feast honoring Mary. However, in<br>
         the twentieth century, the holiday grew into its own celebration and mostly separated from the<br>
         common association with religion. It has become a holiday associated with nationality, relationships,<br>
         and introspection rather than a religious celebration, although many people do still follow older traditions.</h4></div>
